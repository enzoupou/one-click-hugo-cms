In a blog post date April 30, AWS Educate annouced the first cohort of AWS Educate Ambassador Program. 

Ambassadors will have the following benefits:

* Incremental AWS Promotional Credit
* Access to AWS Summits, conferences, and industry events (when applicable)
* Early access, under NDA, to select AWS services
* Limited edition AWS Educate StudentAmbassadorProgram branded items
* Quarterly AWS tech talks on in-demand AWS services such as AWS RoboMaker and AWS DeepLens
* The opportunity to develop public speaking, technical writing, community leadership, and networking skills
* Training and mentorship from Amazon employees

Among the list, India tops the most number of participants. Luckily, I'm one of the 5 participants who will represent the Philippines. I'm taking up my Masters at the University of the Philippines.

Here's a quick timeline of how I got accepted to the program:
